# Sphinx Image Directive Test

This is my attempt to recreate the issue of image directives not working properly in Sphinx by creating a project that is structured the same general way my production project is structured.

My production code is called from root, with modules living in packages.

My documentation lives in a docs directory, the same as presented here.

I use a virtual emvironment, same as here.

I use a great many more libraries than are used here.

I'm using Python 3.8.2
